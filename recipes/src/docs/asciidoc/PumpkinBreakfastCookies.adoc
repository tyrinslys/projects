= Pumpkin Breakfast Cookies
Wendy Schalk
  
This recipe is from a blog I can't remember and adapted it to be more breakfasty.
It makes things that are not quite cookies but good and savory enough to count as breakfast.

== Ingredients

* 2 Large (3 Medium) banannas, ripe and smashed
* 2/3 cup pumpkin puree
* 1/3 cup applesause
* 1/4 cup nutbutter (I prefer using cashew butter)
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 Tbs cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp baking powder (aluminum free prefered)
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 cups rolled oats (not quick)
* 1/2 cup wallnuts, chopped
* 1/2 cup rasiens
* 1/4 cup coconut, shredded (perfer the finely shredded kind)

== Instructions

 . Mix well the banannas, pumpkin, applesause, nutbutter, and vanilla together in a bowl.
 . Mix dry ingredients together really good.
 . Combine wet and dry.
 . Preheat the oven at 350 deg F.
 . Rest for 10 min, the batter, not you silly.
 . Shape into patties, about 1/4 cup of batter per cookie.
  * These will not spread or change much at all when cooking in the oven so be sure that they are the shape you want before putting them in.
 . Bake on silicone mats for 23min.
