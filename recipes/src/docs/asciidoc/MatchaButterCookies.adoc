I made something like these before and didn't write the recipe down. These were made as a St. Patrick's day cookie.
This recipe is based on the https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3931154-ratio[Ratio] book 1.2.3. shortbread cookie and comes in two parts that are flattened separately and combined to make colorful cookies.

These cookies turn out buttery, sweet, and bitter.
