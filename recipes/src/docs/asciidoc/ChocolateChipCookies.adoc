= Canadian Living's Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
This is my best chocolate chip cookie recipe. I have greatly modified this recipe to make a cake-like cookie (not chewy and not crisp).
I also have many variants of this recipe, my favorite is Lemon Ginger Chocolate Chip.

== Ingredients

 * 1 cup butter 
 * 1 cup granulated sugar 
 * 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed 
 * 3 large eggs 
 * 2 tsp vanilla 
 * 3 cups all-purpose flour 
 * 1 teaspoon baking soda 
 * 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 * 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
 * 1 cup walnuts, chopped

== Directions
 1. 1. Leave the butter in a large bowl on the counter overnight to get soft.
 1. Cream in the sugars.
 1. Beat in the eggs and vanilla.
 1. Combine flour, salt, and baking soda.
 1. Mix into the creamed mixture.
 1. Stir in the chips and nuts.
 1. Chill for 30 min in fridge.
 1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F
 1. Drop by the spoonful on a cookie sheet.
 1. Bake for 8-11 min.

== Notes
 * instead of baking, roll into tubes and cover with wax paper then freeze, bake later by cutting the tubes with a sharp knife. By freezing you can have cookies in 20 min anytime you want.
