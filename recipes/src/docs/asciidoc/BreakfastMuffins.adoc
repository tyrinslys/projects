= Breakfast Muffins
Written by Dessert Person.

The first time I made this recipe the batter was too thick.
I had 2 things working aginst me: 1.) cold ingredients turning the oil solid. 2.) thicker applesauce.
They ened up fine, just a bit thick.

== Ingredients
=== Muffin
==== Dry
 * 1 cup all-purpose flour (4.6 oz /130g)
 * 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (2.5 oz / 70g)
 * 2 1/4 tsp baking powder (0.32 oz / 9g)
 * 1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
 * 3/4 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt
==== Wet
 * 2 Tbs flax meal (0.46 oz / 13g)
 * 1 cup unsweetened applesauce (8.6 oz / 243g)
 * 1/2 cup coconut oil (4 oz / 113g), warmed gently to liquefy
 * 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar (2.3 oz / 65g)
 * 1/4 cup maple syrup (2.8 oz / 80g)
 * 2 tsp vanilla extract
==== Mix-ins
 * 1/3 cup pumpkin seeds, hulled
 * 1/4 cup sunflower seeds, hulled
 * 1 cup frozen blueberries (5 oz / 140g)

=== Topping
 * 2 Tbs pumpkin seeds, hulled
 * 1 Tbs sunflower seeds, hulled
 * 1 tablespoon demerara sugar
 * 1 tsp white or black chia seeds
 * 1 tsp poppy seeds
 

== Directions
 1. Preheat oven to 350 F.
 1. Toast nuts for muffin on a baking sheet.
 1. Put coconut oil on to heat up.
 1. Put 1/4 cup of water on to boil.
 1. Mix dry.
 1. Flax meal into bowl, whisk in 1/4 cup boiling water. Should become a snotty like consistency.
 1. Whisk in applesauce then oil.
 1. After oil is incorporated the rest of the wet get mixed in.
 1. Wet goes in dry, stir... being careful not to go overboard.
 1. Fold in the mix-in ingredients.
 1. Spoon out into muffin things
 1. Heavily sprinkle topping
 1. Bake for around an hour at 350 deg F.
 
== Notes:
 * Our applesauce is thick, maybe use half applesauce and half water.
 * warming applesauce to room temp can help to keep oil from going back to solid state.
 * blueberries are a bit big for these... try wild blueberries instead.
