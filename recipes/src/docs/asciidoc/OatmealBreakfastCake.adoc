= Carrot cake baked oatmeal

This "cake" is great for breakfast. It is more like breakfast than cake. Easily a favorite.
Makes an 8x8 pan.

== Ingredients
* 2 ½ cups rolled oats
* ½ cup applesauce, heaping (so it’s probably more like 2/3 cup)
* 10 oz can crushed pineapple in pineapple juice
* 1 cup finely grated carrot
* 1 tsp cinnamon, heaping
* ½ tsp ginger, heaping
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 ½ tsp baking powder
* ¼ cup dried unsweetened shredded coconut
* 2 large eggs
* ¼ cup brown sugar, only lightly packed
* ½ tsp salt
* ¼ cup melted butter

== Directions

1. In a large mixing bowl with a cover, mix the oats, applesauce, and pineapple. Cover and leave in the refrigerator overnight.*
1. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Butter an 8x8 baking dish.
1. Add carrot, cinnamon, ginger, vanilla, baking powder, and coconut to the bowl with the oats.
1. Melt butter in a small saucepan. Mix the melted butter, sugar and salt. Beat the eggs in one at a time.
1. Combine everything in the large bowl and stir well. Pour into the baking dish and flatten.
1. Bake at 350 F for 50 minutes.

== Notes
* I use thick rolled oats so the soaking overnight helps them hydrate and soften.
