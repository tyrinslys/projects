= Raspberry Habanero BBQ sauce

This is something I'm testing out. I've seen some recipes that use raspberry 
preserves but that ingredient doesn't really have a lot of berries. The general
idea is, more berries, less sugar, and a nice spice level. For heat I'm going for
pleasantly warm.

Makes ???

== Ingredients
* 2 1/3 cups of Raspberries fresh/frozen
* 1 tablespoon molasses
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
* 2 habanero peppers (with seeds)
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper


== Directions
1. In a saucepan, combine all of the ingredients.
1. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer.
1. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about ?? minutes, stirring occasionally.
1. Remove the sauce from the heat and let it cool slightly.
1. Transfer the sauce to a blender or food processor and blend until smooth.
1. Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any seeds.
1. Let the sauce cool completely before using.

== Notes
* may need more sugar... planning to add to taste at the end.
* most other BBQ sauce recipes have ketchup ... not sure I'll add tho.
