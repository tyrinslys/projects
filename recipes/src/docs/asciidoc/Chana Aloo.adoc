= Chana Aloo

It was made as curry #12 of our 52 curry challenge. This has become a great staple recipe in my house.

Makes 6 portions.

== Ingredients

=== Spices
 * 2 tbsp curry powder
 * 1 tsp All Spice powder
 * 1 tsp nutmeg powder, freshly grated
 * 1 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
 * 2 tsp dried thyme leaves
 * 1 tsp cumin powder
 * 1/2 tsp black pepper

=== Curry
 * 4 tbsp coconut oil
 * 2 large garlic cloves, minced
 * 1 large onion, diced
 * 1 habanero, minced
 * 2 cups potatoes, cut into 1/2" cubes
 * 28 oz canned chickpeas, drained (or 3 1/2 cups of cooked chickpeas)
 * 1 cups chicken stock
 * 2 tbsp fresh parsley , finely chopped (or coriander/cilantro)
 * Salt to taste (if chicken broth is unsalted this comes out to 1 1/4 tsp salt)


== Directions
 1. Do what is needed to get the rice cooked, it is not a part of this recipe.
 1. Heat oil in a large pot or very deep skillet over medium high heat.
 1. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes until onion is translucent.
 1. Add Habenero, cook for another minute.
 1. Add Curry Spices and stir for 1 minute.
 1. Add the potatoes and stir to coat in the Spices. If the spices start to stick to the bottom of the pot, add a tiny splash of water.
 1. Add the chickpeas nnd chicken broth. Bring to simmer then turn down the heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked and the sauce has thickened.
 1. Adjust salt to taste, stir in and parsley.
 1. Serve with rice - basmati would be ideal

== Notes
 * I use either cilantro or parsley (whatever is on hand). The green herb is required for best taste.
